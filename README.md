## Tech and Data Used

### Frameworks
The main framework used was Ruby on Rails. For the front-end side of the software, we used BootStrap and jQuery

### Tools
We used several gems and frameworks readily available in Rails. Most notable are the following:
a.) Pry
b.) jQuery
c.) ElasticSearch
d.) CarrierWave
e.) BootStrap-SASS
f.) FontAwesome
g.) Particles.js

### Languages (Programming, Markup, Scripting)
The languages used were Ruby, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Open Data
Instead of utilizing open data we created our own system of open data dealing with the idea of mass intellectual transfer that is readily accessible by any Filipino, student or non-student, industry or academe, individual or institution, private sector or even our own government.
